        <h1>Miloš Crnjanski</h1>
        <header><p>Miloš Crnjanski <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">(October 1893 – 30 November 1977)</span> was a poet of the expressionist wing of Serbian modernism, author, and a diplomat. 
            From his beginnings as a journalist whose social-political stance was at one moment openly opposed to freedom and progress, he gradually arose to become a poet and romanticist.

            <p>Crnjanski was born in Csongrad, Hungary, to an impoverished family which moved in 1896 to Temesvar (Romania), where he grew up in a patriarchal-patriotic community with the implanted cult of Serbia and Serbian heritage in his soul as a precious relic.
