    <h1 id="NikolaTesla">Nikola Tesla</h1>
    <p><strong>Nikola Tesla</strong> <i>(10 July 1856 – 7 January 1943)</i> was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, physicist, and futurist who 
        is best known for his contributions to the design of the modern <ins>alternating current (AC) electricity supply system</ins>.</p>
    <p>Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla received an advanced education in engineering and physics in the 1870s and gained practical experience
        in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry. He emigrated to the United States in 1884, 
        where he would become a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his own. 
        With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and
         mechanical devices. His alternating current (AC) induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, 
        earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company would eventually market.</p>
    <p>Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical 
        discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a wireless-controlled boat, one of the first ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an 
        inventor and would demonstrate his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his showmanship at public lectures.
        Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his high-voltage, 
        high-frequency power experiments in New York and Colorado Springs. In 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with his
         devices. Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project, an intercontinental wireless communication and 
        power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete it.</p>
    <p>After Wardenclyffe, Tesla went on to try to develop a series of inventions in the 1910s and 1920s with varying degrees of success. Having spent most of 
        his money, he lived in a series of New York hotels, leaving behind unpaid bills. Tesla died in New York City in January 1943. His work fell into relative
        obscurity following his death, but in 1960, the General Conference on Weights and Measures named the SI unit of magnetic flux density the tesla in his 
        honor. There has been a resurgence in popular interest in Tesla since the 1990s</p>

        <li>The Nikola Tesla Memorial Centre in Smiljan, Croatia, opened in 2006. It features a statue of Tesla designed by sculptor Mile Blažević</li>
        <li>A plaque depicting a relief of Nikola Tesla is present on the Old City Hall (Zagreb) in Zagreb,
            Croatia's capital, commemorating his proposal to build an alternating current power station,
            which he made to the city council. The plaque quotes Tesla's statement, given in the building
            on 24 May 1892, which reads: <i>"As a son of this country, I consider it my duty to help the
            City of Zagreb in every way, either through counsel or through action" (Serbian:
            "Smatram svojom dužnošću da kao rođeni sin svoje zemlje pomognem gradu Zagrebu u svakom 
            pogledu savjetom i činom")</i></li>
        <li>On 7 July 2006, on the corner of Masarykova and Preradovićeva streets in the Lower Town area 
            in Zagreb, a monument of Tesla was unveiled. This monument was designed by Ivan Meštrović 
            in 1952 and was transferred from the Zagreb-based Ruđer Bošković Institute where it had
            spent previous decades.</li>
        <li>A monument to Tesla was established at Niagara Falls, New York. This monument portraying Tesla
            reading a set of notes was sculpted by Frano Kršinić. It was presented to the United States 
            by Yugoslavia in 1976 and is an identical copy of the monument standing in front of the
            University of Belgrade Faculty of Electrical Engineering.</li>
        <li>A monument of Tesla standing on a portion of an alternator was established at Queen Victoria
            Park in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada. The monument was officially unveiled on 9 July 2006
            on the 150th anniversary of Tesla's birth. The monument was sponsored by St. George Serbian
            Church, Niagara Falls, and designed by Les Drysdale of Hamilton, Ontario. Drysdale's design 
           was the winning design from an international competition.</li>
        <li>A monument of Tesla was unveiled in Baku in 2013. Presidents Ilham Aliyev and Tomislav Nikolić
            attended a ceremony of unveiling.</li>
        <li>In 2012 Jane Alcorn, president of the nonprofit group Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe, 
            and Matthew Inman, creator of web cartoon The Oatmeal, raised a total of <ins>$2,220,511 – $1,370,511</ins>
            from a campaign and $850,000 from a New York State grant—to buy the property where Wardenclyffe
            Tower once stood and eventually turn it into a museum.The group began negotiations to purchase
            the Long Island property from Agfa Corporation in October 2012. The purchase was completed in
            May 2013. The preservation effort and history of Wardenclyffe is the subject of a documentary
            by Tesla activist/filmmaker Joseph Sikorski called "Tower to the People-Tesla's Dream at
            Wardenclyffe Continues.</li>

    <h1 id="PersonalLife">Personal Life</h1>
    <p>Tesla worked every day from <ins>9:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m.</ins>> or later, with dinner from exactly 8:10 p.m., 
        at Delmonico's restaurant and later the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Tesla would telephone his dinner 
        order to the headwaiter, who also could be the only one to serve him. "The meal was required to be ready 
        at eight o'clock ... He dined alone, except on the rare occasions when he would give a dinner to a group 
        to meet his social obligations. Tesla would then resume his work, often until 3:00 a.m.".</p>
    <p>For exercise, Tesla walked between 8 and 10 miles (13 and 16 km) per day. He curled his toes one hundred 
        times for each foot every night, saying that it stimulated his brain cells.</p>
    <p>In an interview with newspaper editor Arthur Brisbane, Tesla said that he did not
        believe in telepathy, stating, "Suppose I made up my mind to murder you," he said,
        "In a second you would know it. Now, isn't that wonderful? By what process does the
        mind get at all this?" In the same interview, Tesla said that he believed that all 
        fundamental laws could be reduced to one.</p>
    <h2>Eidetic memory</h2>
    <p>Tesla read many works, memorizing complete books, and supposedly possessed a photographic memory.He 
        was a polyglot, speaking eight languages: Serbo-Croatian, Czech, English, French, German, Hungarian,
        Italian, and Latin. Tesla related in his autobiography that he experienced detailed moments of inspiration. 
        During his early life, Tesla was repeatedly stricken with illness. He suffered a peculiar affliction in which
        blinding flashes of light would appear before his eyes, often accompanied by visions.Often, the visions were
        linked to a word or idea he might have come across; at other times they would provide the solution to a 
        particular problem he had encountered. Just by hearing the name of an item, he would be able to envision 
        it in realistic detail.Tesla would visualize an invention in his mind with extreme precision, including all
        dimensions, before moving to the construction stage, a technique sometimes known as picture thinking. 
        He typically did not make drawings by hand but worked from memory. Beginning in his childhood, Tesla had
        frequent flashbacks to events that had happened previously in his life.</p>
    <h2>Sleep habits</h2>
    <p>Tesla claimed never to sleep more than two hours per night.However, he did admit to "dozing" from time
        to time <i>"to recharge his batteries."</i>  During his second year of study at Graz, Tesla developed
        a passionate proficiency for billiards, chess, and card-playing, sometimes spending more than 48 hours 
        in a stretch at a gaming table. On one occasion at his laboratory, Tesla worked for a period of 84 hours 
        without rest.Kenneth Swezey, a journalist whom Tesla had befriended, confirmed that Tesla rarely slept. 
        Swezey recalled one morning when Tesla called him at 3 a.m.: "I was sleeping in my room like one dead ... 
        Suddenly, the telephone ring awakened me ... [Tesla] spoke animatedly, with pauses, [as he] ... work[ed] 
        out a problem, comparing one theory to another, commenting; and when he felt he had arrived at the solution,
        he suddenly closed the telephone."</p>
